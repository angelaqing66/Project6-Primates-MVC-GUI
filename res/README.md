# Primate Sanctuary Management System

## Overview
The Primate Sanctuary Management System is the culmination of efforts from CS5004 class to implement a robust application following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This project enhances our existing Primates Project by integrating a graphical user interface using Java Swing, which allows for interactive and intuitive management of primate sanctuaries.

## Features
TODO: Provide a detailed description of the project features, such as:

- **MVC Architecture**: The system is designed with the separation of concerns in mind, clearly distinguishing between the model (data), the view (UI), and the controller (logic and user input handling).
- **Interactive GUI**: Utilizing Java Swing, the application offers a graphical user interface for easy data manipulation and visualization.
- **Primate Management**: Facility to register new primates, manage their health records, and assign them to appropriate enclosures.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on primate status, enclosure occupancy, and more.

## How To Run
The Primate Sanctuary Management System can be run as a standalone application through its JAR executable.

1. Navigate to the `jar` folder located in the root directory of the project.
2. Run the JAR file by double-clicking on it, or via the command line using:


## How to Use the Program
Upon launching the application, you'll be presented with a user interface to interact with the system.

TODO: Include step-by-step instructions on how to use the program, such as:

- How to register a new primate.
- How to move primates to different enclosures.
- How to view and interpret the generated reports.

## Requirements
To run the Primate Sanctuary Management System, ensure that you have the following:

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or above installed on your machine.
